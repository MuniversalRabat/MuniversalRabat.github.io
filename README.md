# Welcome to WAH-Candipocalypse!

This is just a working title as I mash together several interests (So far, Animal Crossing, Fallout, and the 'Candy World' motif) in order to learn more about Java Programming in general, and modding Minecraft (1.12.2) specifically!

## Heavily Work-In-Progress
I am just starting out and have been only learning code for a little less than a month in this bout, although I've had previous experience butting my head into this ring. That said, this is my first serious attempt at learning this, and making it better overall. So with some luck, some tenacity, and a whole lot of screaming at my monitor, I'm sure I'll make something that is... interesting, at least! My first update to this is as of October 2nd, 2019, so here's hoping this won't be too scary.
